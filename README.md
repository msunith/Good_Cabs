### Project Description:
Goodcabs, a cab service company established two years ago, has gained a strong foothold in the Indian market by focusing on tier-2 cities.

With operations in ten tier-2 cities across India, Goodcabs has set ambitious performance targets for 2024 to drive growth and improve passenger satisfaction.
